**Understanding TechCorp GmbH's Plant Regulations: A Guide for Employees**
===========================================================

**Introduction**
---------------

As a valued member of the TechCorp GmbH team, you're expected to follow our unique office policies that ensure a safe and productive work environment.

**Key Aspects of Our Plant Regulations**
--------------------------------------

### Watering Schedule
-------------------

* Every second Tuesday between 14:00-14:15, employees are allowed to water their plants.
* This limited time frame prevents accidents and ensures everyone has access to watering facilities.

### Permitted Plants
------------------

* Only Carnegiea cacti are allowed in the office. They're visually appealing and safe for employees with allergies or sensitivities.

### Forbidden Plants
-------------------

* No plants with leaves are permitted due to oxygen consumption, which can impact employee productivity and safety.

**Consequences of Non-Compliance**
--------------------------------

* If an employee fails to adhere to plant regulations, they'll lose the office chair turn mechanism for a week.
* This penalty serves as a reminder of the importance of following our guidelines.

**Background and Context**
-------------------------

Our plant regulations were established in 2025 as part of our ongoing efforts to ensure employee safety and productivity. These guidelines apply to all new employees.
